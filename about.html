                Hey there! Iâ€™m Chris, and I am sure I, along with a good chunk of 
                the people reading this have been playing Minecraft for a while, 
                a good chunk of you also probably started playing on Minecraft 
                Console Editon as it was quite popular for its time, but, now it 
                has been forgotten to history and many of us miss it but have no 
                way of going to older versions to experience all the updates and 
                even if they can, it still doesnt feel the same, well, everything 
                is about to change, I am hosting this fan event for the community 
                to go back to this old version of minecraft and play every version 
                of this game from TU0 to TU75, we will all update at the same time 
                and can pretend that we traveled in time and still have the same 
                hype we had again in the not so buggy and fun Minecraft Xbox 360 
                Edition, there are tutorials on this website which you can use to 
                join in on the event and re-experience your childhood and if you 
                are new here or didnt start at the beginning then you can also 
                join to experience the version of Minecraft that the OG players 
                have played on.
